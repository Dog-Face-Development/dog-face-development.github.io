</p>
<h3 id="revocation-of-patent-license">Revocation of patent license</h3>
<p>
  You (or Your employer) reserve the right to revoke the patent license stated
  in section 3.1 if We make any infringement claim that is targeted at your
  Contribution and not asserted for a Defensive Purpose. An assertion of claims
  of the Patents shall be considered for a "Defensive Purpose" if the claims are
  asserted against an entity that has filed, maintained, threatened, or
  voluntarily participated in a patent infringement lawsuit against Us or any of
  Our licensees.
</p>
<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>
<p>
  THE CONTRIBUTION IS PROVIDED "AS IS". MORE PARTICULARLY, ALL EXPRESS OR
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
  SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT
  ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED BY YOU TO US AND BY US TO YOU. TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY
  SUCH WARRANTIES CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED, SUCH WARRANTY IS LIMITED IN DURATION AND
  EXTENT TO THE MINIMUM PERIOD AND EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
</p>
<h2 id="consequential-damage-waiver">Consequential Damage Waiver</h2>
<p>
  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL YOU (OR
  YOUR EMPLOYER) OR WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF ANTICIPATED
  SAVINGS, LOSS OF DATA, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL AND
  EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL OR
  EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED.
</p>
<h2 id="approximation-of-disclaimer-and-damage-waiver">
  Approximation of Disclaimer and Damage Waiver
</h2>
<p>
  IF THE DISCLAIMER AND DAMAGE WAIVER MENTIONED IN SECTION 5. AND SECTION 6.
  CANNOT BE GIVEN LEGAL EFFECT UNDER APPLICABLE LOCAL LAW, REVIEWING COURTS
  SHALL APPLY LOCAL LAW THAT MOST CLOSELY APPROXIMATES AN ABSOLUTE WAIVER OF ALL
  CIVIL OR CONTRACTUAL LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONTRIBUTION.
</p>
<h2 id="term">Term</h2>
<p>
  This Agreement shall come into effect upon Your (or Your employer's)
  acceptance of the terms and conditions.
</p>
<p>
  This Agreement shall apply for the term of the copyright and patents licensed
  here. However, You (and your employer) shall have the right to terminate the
  Agreement if We do not fulfill the obligations as set forth in Section 4. Such
  termination must be made in writing.
</p>
<p>
  In the event of a termination of this Agreement Sections 5., 6., 7., 8., and
  9. shall survive such termination and shall remain in full force thereafter.
  For the avoidance of doubt, Free and Open Source Software (sub)licenses that
  have already been granted for Contributions at the date of the termination
  shall remain in full force after the termination of this Agreement.
</p>
<h2 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>
  This Agreement and all disputes, claims, actions, suits or other proceedings
  arising out of this agreement or relating in any way to it shall be governed
  by the laws of British Columbia, Canada excluding its private international
  law provisions.
</p>
<p>
  This Agreement sets out the entire agreement between You (or Your employer)
  and Us for Your Contributions to Us and overrides all other agreements or
  understandings.
</p>
<p>
  In case of Your death, this agreement shall continue with Your heirs. In case
  of more than one heir, all heirs must exercise their rights through a commonly
  authorized person.
</p>
<p>
  If any provision of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, such
  provision will be replaced to the extent possible with a provision that comes
  closest to the meaning of the original provision and that is enforceable. The
  terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement shall apply notwithstanding
  any failure of essential purpose of this Agreement or any limited remedy to
  the maximum extent possible under law.
</p>
<p>
  You (or Your employer) agree to notify Us of any facts or circumstances of
  which you become aware that would make this Agreement inaccurate in any
  respect.
